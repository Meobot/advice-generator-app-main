## My process
I started with the HTML, which was simple enough, then went on to the CSS and learned letter spacing. For the JS, it took some searching to fix the API giving me the same advice, except on refresh. The solution being tieing the fetch to a Math.random method. All in all, a fun and not too difficult project!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- API's

### What I learned

I learned about letter spacing, and being able to tie a fetch to Math.random()

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71255840/fetch-api-return-same-data-always) - This post helped me decipher the issue I had with the API returning the same advice every time it was called.
